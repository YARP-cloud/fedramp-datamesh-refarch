# FedRAMP High Event-Driven Data Mesh Architecture

## Design Principles

1. **Federated Domain Ownership:** Data ownership is decentralized to the domains that best understand and generate the data.
2. **Event-Driven Communication:** Asynchronous event streams serve as the backbone for inter-domain data sharing.
3. **Data as a Product Thinking:** Event streams and derived datasets are treated as first-class products.
4. **Self-Service Platform:** A central platform team provides the infrastructure and tools for domain autonomy.
5. **Federated Computational Governance:** Global standards are defined collaboratively but enforced automatically.
6. **LakeHouse Architecture:** Combines data lakes (S3) and data warehouses (Databricks/Iceberg) for unified analytics.
7. **Security by Design:** FedRAMP High security controls are embedded throughout the architecture.
8. **Open Standards and Extensibility:** Prefer open standards (Iceberg, Parquet, Avro) to avoid vendor lock-in.

## High-Level Architecture

The architecture consists of two main layers:

### 1. Shared Data Mesh Platform
- **Event Bus:** Apache Kafka (AWS MSK) for real-time event streaming
- **Schema Registry:** Confluent Schema Registry for schema validation and evolution
- **Storage Layer:** AWS S3 with Apache Iceberg for table format
- **Compute Engine:** Databricks for data processing and analytics
- **Data Catalog:** Databricks Unity Catalog for discovery and governance
- **Infrastructure:** AWS services configured for FedRAMP High compliance

### 2. Domain Components
Each business domain (e.g., Projects, Financials) owns:
- **Data Producers:** Components that capture data from source systems and publish events
- **Data Processors:** Spark/Flink jobs for transforming raw events into data products
- **Data Products:** Event streams and derived datasets provided for consumption
- **Data Consumers:** Applications or processes that consume data products

## Event-Driven Communication

Domains communicate primarily through state events:
- Events capture the full state of an entity after a change
- Events are immutable and append-only
- Events are published to Kafka topics with defined schemas
- Consumers can subscribe to events to build derived views

## Security & Compliance

FedRAMP High compliance is achieved through:
- Encryption of data at rest and in transit
- Strict access controls and authentication
- Comprehensive audit logging and monitoring
- Network segmentation and security
- Regular security assessments and patching

## Data Flow Patterns

1. **Source to Event Stream:** Capture data changes from source systems using CDC and publish as events
2. **Event Stream to Derived Table:** Process events to create queryable tables in Iceberg format
3. **Cross-Domain Data Products:** Combine events from multiple domains to create integrated views
4. **Developer Local Environment:** Query data products locally using the CLI tool with DuckDB

## Technology Components

- **AWS Infrastructure:** VPC, S3, MSK, IAM, KMS, CloudTrail, GuardDuty, etc.
- **Event Streaming:** Apache Kafka (AWS MSK)
- **Schema Management:** Confluent Schema Registry with Avro/Protobuf
- **Change Data Capture:** Debezium running on Kafka Connect
- **Data Processing:** Databricks (Spark) for batch and streaming
- **Table Format:** Apache Iceberg (primary), Delta Lake (secondary)
- **Data Catalog:** Databricks Unity Catalog
- **Developer CLI:** Go with Charm.sh and DuckDB
