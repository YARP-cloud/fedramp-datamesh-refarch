# FedRAMP High Compliance Guide

This document outlines how the FedRAMP High Event-Driven Data Mesh architecture meets FedRAMP High security requirements.

## FedRAMP High Overview

FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. FedRAMP High is the most stringent baseline, designed for systems that process highly sensitive unclassified data.

## Security Controls Implementation

## Continuous Monitoring

The following continuous monitoring activities are implemented:

1. **Daily**:
   - Automated security scans
   - Log analysis for security events
   - Infrastructure health checks

2. **Weekly**:
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Security control compliance checks
   - Access review for critical systems

3. **Monthly**:
   - Comprehensive security review
   - Patch status verification
   - Penetration testing (rotating focus)

4. **Quarterly**:
   - Full system security assessment
   - Third-party security reviews
   - Table-top security exercises

## Incident Response

An incident response plan is documented and regularly tested, with the following components:

1. **Detection and Analysis**:
   - Security monitoring tools
   - Alert thresholds and triggers
   - Initial assessment procedures

2. **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**:
   - Containment strategies by incident type
   - Eradication procedures
   - Recovery processes and verification

3. **Post-Incident Activity**:
   - Root cause analysis
   - Lessons learned
   - Improvement implementation

## Documentation and Evidence

All security controls are documented with supporting evidence, including:

1. **Policies and Procedures**:
   - Access control policies
   - Incident response procedures
   - Change management processes

2. **Technical Documentation**:
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Configuration settings
   - Security control implementation details

3. **Testing Evidence**:
