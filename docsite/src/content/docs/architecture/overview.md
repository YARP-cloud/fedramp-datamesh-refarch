description: An overview of the FedRAMP High Event-Driven Data Mesh architecture.
---

This document provides a high-level overview of the FedRAMP High Event-Driven Data Mesh architecture, including its key components, interactions, and design principles.

## Architecture Overview

The FedRAMP High Event-Driven Data Mesh is a decentralized, domain-driven architecture for managing data in a secure and scalable way, compliant with FedRAMP High security requirements. It combines the principles of Data Mesh (domain ownership, data as a product, self-service platform, federated governance) with Event-Driven Architecture (events as the primary communication mechanism).

## Key Components

### Self-Service Platform

The platform layer provides shared infrastructure, tools, and capabilities for domains to create, manage, and consume data products:

1. **Event Bus (Kafka)**: Central nervous system for event propagation
2. **Schema Registry**: Central repository for schema management and validation
3. **Data Lake Storage (S3/Iceberg)**: Scalable, durable storage for data products
4. **Compute Engine (Databricks)**: Processing engine for data transformation and analysis
5. **Data Catalog (Unity Catalog)**: Discovery and governance of data products
6. **Infrastructure**: AWS services configured for FedRAMP compliance

### Domain Components

Each business domain (e.g., Project Management, Financials) owns:

1. **Data Producers**: Components that capture data from source systems and publish events
2. **Data Processors**: Jobs for transforming raw events into data products
3. **Data Products**: Event streams and derived datasets provided for consumption
4. **Data Consumers**: Applications or processes that consume data products

### Developer Experience

Tools and APIs for developers to interact with the data mesh:

1. **CLI Tool**: Go-based command-line interface for local querying and discovery
2. **APIs**: Interfaces for programmatic access to data products
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for using the platform

## Security and Compliance

FedRAMP High compliance is achieved through:

1. **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit
2. **Access Control**: Fine-grained access control at multiple levels
3. **Monitoring and Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails and monitoring
4. **Network Security**: Strict network controls and segmentation
5. **Vulnerability Management**: Regular scanning and patching

## Event-Driven Communication

Domains communicate primarily through events:

1. **State Events**: Capture the full state of an entity after a change
2. **Schema Registry**: Ensures schemas are well-defined and evolve safely
3. **Topic Naming**: Well-defined naming conventions for discoverability
4. **Kafka Security**: Secure configuration of Kafka for FedRAMP compliance

## Data Product Structure

Data products follow a standard structure:

1. **Metadata**: Description, ownership, classification, etc.
2. **Schema**: Well-defined schema registered in Schema Registry
3. **Access Control**: Permissions for who can access the data
4. **Quality Metrics**: SLAs and quality measurements
5. **Lineage**: Information about data origins and transformations

## Deployment Model

The architecture is deployed on AWS, utilizing:

1. **AWS GovCloud**: FedRAMP-authorized AWS region
2. **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code for provisioning
3. **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration for supporting services
4. **AWS Services**: S3, MSK, IAM, KMS, etc.
